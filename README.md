## Overview

Welcome to the LineTrackerArduino project! This repository documents the work of a dynamic team comprising four computer science students who are enthusiastic participants in a thrilling robotics competition. Hosted by the Robotics Club and Innovation Arts et MÃ©tiers, this event is a cornerstone for the students of the University MOULAY ISMAIL-Meknes. The ultimate goal of this competition is to select exceptional teams for the prestigious "African Robotic Brains 22" finals. These finals assemble teams not only from all corners of Morocco but also from across Africa, fostering an environment of innovation and competition.
